                        Buyers hold the same credentials as Hosted Buyers, but have the flexibility of visiting without the obligation to take part in pre-scheduled meetings. Hosted buyers receive a reimbursement of the registration fee once the requirements of the program are met.

                    <p>
                        If you would like to express an interest in registering, please complete and submit the Pre-Qualification form found on the banner to the right.
