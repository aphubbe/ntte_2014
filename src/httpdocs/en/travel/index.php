                        Mexico City is the country's largest city as well as its most important political, cultural, educational, and financial center. It is located in the Valley of Mexico, a large valley in the high plateaus at the center of Mexico, at an altitude of 2,240 meters (7,350 ft.).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The city was inaugurated by the Mexicas in 1325. The Mexicas were one of the last of the Náhuatl-speaking peoples who migrated to this part of the Valley of Mexico after the fall of the Toltec Empire.
